# IIMs_classification

The datasets we used and the model weights  trained by us can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kIqBICBSpfWjeK2WiHZ07w. The extraction code is IIMs . Thank you for your attention.

In the data folder, there are csv files specifying the training and test images used for each scene and fold.

In the weights folder, there are some h5 files that can be used for model testing.

# models

# test 
In the test file, the code used for model testing is given. In addition we give the test results for each model in various classification scenarios.
